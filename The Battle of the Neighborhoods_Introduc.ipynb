Inorder to finalise a neighborhood to hunt for an apartment, **safety** is considered as a top concern when moving to a new place. If you don\u2019t feel safe in your own home, you\u2019re not going to be able to enjoy living there. The **crime statistics** will provide an insight into this issue.\n\nWe will focus on the safest borough and explore its neighborhoods and the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood so that the best neighborhood suited to an individual's needs can be selected."
